# Mobileum REACT Challenge

Smart Phone Management

## Description

This application is built with React and TypeScript, and uses webpack for bundling.

## Key Features

1. Webpack
2. Theming support - Styled Components
3. Responsive Design
4. Context API - State Management

## Context API - State Container

Since all the data required to render the application comes from a Single Data Source, it's better to have a state container that holds the data to avoid multiple API calls. As there is no requirement for complicated data management, ContextAPI looks like the obvious choice.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM

## How To Run

1.  First Git Clone Or Download Project
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
2.  To install dependencies run: `npm install`.
3.  To start the application run: `npm start`.
